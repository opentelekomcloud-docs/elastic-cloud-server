Deleting the Password for Logging In to an ECS
==============================================

Function
--------

This API is used to delete the recorded random password generated during initial Windows ECS installation. After the password is deleted, you can still use your password to log in to your ECS. However, you cannot use the **Get Password** function to recover the ECS initial password.

Linux ECSs do not use this API to delete a password.
