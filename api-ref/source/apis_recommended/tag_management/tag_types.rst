Tag Types
=========

Tag management APIs are classified as the APIs for one-dimensional (1D) tags and the APIs for two-dimensional (2D) tags.

-  A 1D tag contains a string. All APIs for 1D tags are native OpenStack APIs. For details, see section :ref:`Tag Management <en-us_topic_0108433460>`.
-  A 2D tag consists of a key and a value. All APIs for 2D tags are ECS APIs. For details, see this section.

.. note::

   -  Use the APIs of the same type to add, delete, modify, or query tags.
   -  2D tags are recommended.
