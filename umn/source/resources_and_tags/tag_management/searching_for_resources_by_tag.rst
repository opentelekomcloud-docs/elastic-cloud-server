Searching for Resources by Tag
==============================

After tags are added to resources, you can search for resources by tag using either of the following methods.

Searching for ECSs by Tag
-------------------------

On the **Elastic Cloud Server** page, search for ECSs by tag key-value pair.

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

#. Under **Computing**, choose **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. In the search box, select **Tag** and then a key-value pair, and click **OK**.

   You can search for ECSs by multiple tags and they are automatically joined with AND.
