      **Figure 1** Searching for ECSs by tag

#. Enter the tag of the ECS to be searched for.

   Neither the tag key nor value can be empty. When the tag key or value is matched, the system automatically shows the target ECSs.

#. Add tags.

   The system supports multiple tags and uses the intersection set of all tags to search for ECSs.

#. Click **Search**.

   The system searches for ECSs based on tag keys and values.

Filtering Resources on the TMS Console
--------------------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, click **Tag Management Service**.

#. On the **Resource Tags** page, set the search criteria, including **Region**, **Resource Type**, and **Resource Tag**.

#. Click **Search**.

   All the resources that meet the search criteria will be displayed in the **Search Result** area.
