How Can I Obtain the Mapping Between Disk Partitions and Disk Devices on a Linux ECS?
=====================================================================================

For a Linux ECS, its disk partitions correspond to disk devices. This section uses a Linux ECS running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as an example to describe how to obtain the mapping between disk partitions and disk devices.

#. Log in to the Linux ECS as user **root**.

#. Right-click in the blank area of the desktop and choose **Open Terminal** from the shortcut menu.
