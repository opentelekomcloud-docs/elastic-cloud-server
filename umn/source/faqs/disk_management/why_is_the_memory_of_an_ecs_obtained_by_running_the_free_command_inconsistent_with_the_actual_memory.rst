Why Is the Memory of an ECS Obtained by Running the **free** Command Inconsistent with the Actual Memory?
=========================================================================================================

Symptom
-------

After you create an ECS, you run the **free -m** command to view the ECS memory. The ECS memory is less than the memory configured during ECS creation.

An example is provided as follows:

For example, you configure the memory as 4,194,304 KB (4,096 MB) when you create the ECS. After the ECS is created, you run the **free -m** command to view its memory. The command output is as follows:

.. code-block::

   [root@localhost ~]# free -m
   total used free shared buff/cache available
   Mem: 3790 167 3474 8 147 3414
   Swap: 1022 0 1022

The memory in the command output is 3790 MB, which is less than the configured 4096 MB.

Run the **dmidecode -t memory** command to check the actual memory configured for the ECS. The command output is as follows:

.. code-block::

   [root@localhost ~]# dmidecode -t memory
   # dmidecode 3.0
   Getting SMBIOS data from sysfs.
   SMBIOS 2.8 present.

   Handle 0x1000, DMI type 16, 23 bytes
   Physical Memory Array

   Part Number: Not Specified

   Maximum Voltage: Unknown
   Configured Voltage: Unknown

The memory in the command output is the same as that configured during ECS creation.

Possible Causes
---------------

When the OS is started, related devices are initialized, which occupies memory. In addition, when the kernel is started, it also occupies memory. The memory occupied by kdump can be set. Unless otherwise specified, do not change the memory size occupied by kdump.

The command output of **free -m** shows the available memory of the ECS, and that of **dmidecode -t memory** shows the hardware memory.

Therefore, the memory obtained by running the **free -m** command is less than the memory configured for the ECS. This is a normal phenomenon.

.. note::

   This is a normal phenomenon even for physical servers.
