What Should I Do If the Page Does not Respond After I Log In to an ECS Using VNC and Do Not Perform Any Operation for a Long Period of Time?
============================================================================================================================================

If you log in to an ECS running Windows 7 through VNC using Internet Explorer 10 or 11 and do not perform any operation for a long time, the VNC page may not respond.

In this case, you can click **AltGr** twice on the VNC page to activate the page.

If the fault persists, contact technical support.
