How Can I Add ECSs Using Local Disks to an ECS Group?
=====================================================

An ECS group logically isolates ECSs. ECSs in the same ECS group support anti-affinity and they are allocated on different hosts.

You can add an ECS to an ECS group in either of the following ways:

-  During creation: When creating an ECS, add the ECS to the ECS group by setting **ECS Group** in **Advanced Settings**.
-  After creation: After creating an ECS, click **Add ECS** to add the ECS to the ECS group.

Instances with local disks can be added to the ECS group at the time of purchase.
