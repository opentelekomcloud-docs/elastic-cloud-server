Can a Deleted ECS Be Restored?
==============================

Whether a deleted ECS can be restored depends on whether data backup was enabled for it.

-  If backup was enabled, you can use the backup files to restore data.
-  If backup was not enabled, data cannot be restored.

Therefore, before deleting an ECS, ensure that the data on the ECS has been backed up or migrated.
