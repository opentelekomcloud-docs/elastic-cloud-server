Can I Forcibly Restart or Stop an ECS?
======================================

Yes. If an ECS remains in the **Restarting** or **Stopping** state for over 30 minutes after it is restarted, you can forcibly restart or stop the ECS as follows:

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. Select the target ECS and click **Restart** or **Stop**.

   A dialog box is displayed to confirm whether you want to restart or stop the ECS.

#. Select **Forcibly restart the preceding ECSs** or **Forcibly stop the preceding ECSs**.

#. Click **OK**.
