How Quickly Can I Obtain an ECS?
================================

Obtaining an ECS can take as little as a few minutes.

The time it takes to obtain an ECS depends on ECS specifications, available resources (such as EVS disks and EIPs), and system load.

.. note::

   If it takes a long time to obtain your ECS, contact customer service.
