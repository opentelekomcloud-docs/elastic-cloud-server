==================================================================================

Possible Causes
---------------

The image based on which the ECS was created supports viewing console logs. However, this function is not enabled on the ECS.

Solution
--------

Enable management console log obtaining on the ECS.

For details, see step 1 in section `Obtaining ECS Console Logs <instances/managing_ecss/obtaining_ecs_console_logs>`__.
