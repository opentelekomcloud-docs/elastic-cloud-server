Will My ECSs Be Deployed in the Same Subnet?
============================================

You can configure whether ECSs are in the same subnet when creating them.

When creating ECSs, you can set a VPC and primary network interface to customize the subnet for the ECSs.

You can also create a VPC and subnet in advance and deploy the ECSs in that subnet when creating ECSs.
