Do ECSs Support GUI?
====================

Windows ECSs are managed through a GUI but Linux ECSs are managed through the CLI. You can configure a GUI if required.

Before installing a GUI on an ECS, ensure that the memory is no less than 2 GiB to prevent GUI installation or ECS startup failures.

For details about how to install a Linux OS on the GUI, see the following:
