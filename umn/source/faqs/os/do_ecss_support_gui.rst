Do ECSs Support GUI?
====================

Windows ECSs are managed through a GUI but Linux ECSs are managed through the CLI. You can configure a GUI if required.

Before installing a GUI on an ECS, ensure that the idle memory is greater than or equal to 2 GiB. Otherwise, the GUI installation may fail or the ECS cannot be started after the installation.

For details about how to install a Linux OS on the GUI, see the following:
