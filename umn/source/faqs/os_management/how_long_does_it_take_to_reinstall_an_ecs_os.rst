How Long Does It Take to Reinstall an ECS OS?
=============================================

Typically, the process of reinstalling the OS of an ECS takes about 1 to 2 minutes to complete. On the ECS console, stop the ECS and choose **More** > **Manage Image/Disk/Backup** > **Reinstall OS** in the **Operation** column.

During this process, the ECS is in **Reinstalling OS** state.
