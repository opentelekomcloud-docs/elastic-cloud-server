How Long Does It Take to Change an ECS OS?
==========================================

Typically, the process of changing the OS of an ECS takes about 1 to 2 minutes. Stop the ECS, click **More** in the **Operation** column, and select **Change OS** from the drop-down list.

During this process, the ECS is in **Changing OS** state.
