How Long Does It Take to Change an ECS OS?
==========================================

Generally, the process of changing the OS of an ECS takes about 1 to 2 minutes to complete. On the ECS console, stop the ECS and choose **More** > **Manage Image/Backup** > **Change OS** in the **Operation** column.

During this process, the ECS is in **Changing OS** state.
