Can I Select Another OS During ECS OS Reinstallation?
=====================================================

No. You can use only the original image of the ECS to reinstall the OS. You need to use a new image if you want to change the OS. For details, see `Changing the OS <instances/managing_ecss/changing_the_os>`__.
