Can I Select Another OS During ECS OS Reinstallation?
=====================================================

No. You can use only the original image of the ECS to reinstall the OS. You need to use a new image if you want to change the OS. For details, see :ref:`Changing the OS <en-us_topic_0031523135>`.
