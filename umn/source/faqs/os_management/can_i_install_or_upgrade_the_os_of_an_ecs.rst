Can I Install or Upgrade the OS of an ECS?
==========================================

You can install or upgrade ECS OSs provided on the cloud platform.

-  When you create an ECS, you can select a public image or a private image created from a public image to install the ECS OS. Select an OS image based on the programming language in the actual application scenario.
-  You can change your ECS OS through the management console, for example, you can upgrade CentOS 7.2 to CentOS 7.3.
