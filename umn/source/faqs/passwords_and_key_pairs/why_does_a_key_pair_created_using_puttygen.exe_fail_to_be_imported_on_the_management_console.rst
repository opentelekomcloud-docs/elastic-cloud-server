Why Does a Key Pair Created Using **puttygen.exe** Fail to Be Imported on the Management Console?
=================================================================================================

Symptom
-------

When you try to import a key pair that you created using **puttygen.exe** on the management console, the system displays a message indicating that the import failed.

Possible Causes
---------------

The format of the public key content does not meet system requirements.

If you store a public key by clicking **Save public key** of **puttygen.exe**, the format of the public key content will change. Therefore, you cannot import the key on the management console.

Solution
--------

Use the locally stored private key and **PuTTY Key Generator** to restore the format of the public key content. Then, import the public key to the management console.

#. Double-click **puttygen.exe** to switch to the **PuTTY Key Generator** page.

#. Click **Load** and select the private key.

   The system automatically loads the private key and restores the format of the public key content in **PuTTY Key Generator**. The content in the red box in :ref:`Figure 2 <en-us_topic_0047654687__fig5530274016810>` is the public key whose format meets system requirements.
