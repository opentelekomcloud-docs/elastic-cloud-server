How Can I Transfer Files from a Local Mac to a Windows ECS?
===========================================================

Scenarios
---------

This section describes how to use Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac to transfer files from a local Mac to a Windows ECS.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  The remote access tool supported by Mac has been installed on the local Mac. This section uses Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac as an example. `Download Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-mac>`__.
-  The target ECS has had an EIP bound.
-  When you log in to the ECS for the first time, ensure that RDP has been enabled on it. To do so, use VNC to log in to the ECS, enable RDP, and access the ECS using MSTSC.

   .. note::

      By default, RDP has been enabled on the ECSs created using a public image.

Procedure
---------

#. Start Microsoft Remote Desktop.
