How Do I Upload Files to My ECS?
================================

Windows
-------

-  File transfer tool

   Install a file transfer tool, such as FileZilla on both the local computer and the Windows ECS and use it to transfer files.

-  (Recommended) Local disk mapping

   Use MSTSC to transfer files. This method does not support resumable transmission. Therefore, do not use this method to transfer large files.

-  FTP site
