How Can I Use WinSCP to Transfer Files from a Local Windows Computer to a Linux ECS?
====================================================================================

Scenarios
---------

WinSCP can be used to securely copy-paste files across local and remote computers. Compared with FTP, WinSCP allows you to use a username and password to access the destination server without any additional configuration on the server.

To transfer a file from a local Windows computer to a Linux ECS, WinSCP is commonly used. This section describes how to transfer files from a local Windows computer to a Linux ECS using WinSCP. In this example, the ECS running CentOS 7.2 is used as an example.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  The target ECS is running.
-  The ECS has an EIP bound. For details, see :ref:`Binding an EIP <en-us_topic_0174917535>`.

-  The security group of the ECS allows traffic on port 22. For details, see :ref:`Configuring Security Group Rules <en-us_topic_0030878383>`.

Solution
--------

#. `Download WinSCP <https://winscp.net/>`__.

2. Install WinSCP.

3. Start WinSCP.

   Set parameters as follows:

   -  **File protocol**: Set this to **SFTP** or **SCP**.
   -  **Host name**: Enter the EIP bound to the ECS. Log in to the management console to obtain the EIP.
   -  **Port number**: **22** by default.
   -  **User Name**: Enter the username for logging in to the ECS.

      -  If the ECS is logged in using an SSH key pair,

         -  The username is **core** for a CoreOS public image.
         -  The username is **root** for a non-CoreOS public image.

      -  If the ECS is logged in using a password, the username is **root** for a public image.

   -  **Password**: the password set when you created the ECS or converted using a key.

4. Click **Login**.

5. Drag a file from the local computer on the left to the remotely logged in ECS on the right to transfer the file.
