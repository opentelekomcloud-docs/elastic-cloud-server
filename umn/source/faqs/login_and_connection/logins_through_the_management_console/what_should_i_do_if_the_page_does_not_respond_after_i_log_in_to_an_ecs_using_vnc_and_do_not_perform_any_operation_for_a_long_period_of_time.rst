What Should I Do If the Page Does not Respond After I Log In to an ECS Using VNC and Do Not Perform Any Operation for a Long Period of Time?

If your computer is running Windows 7 and you logged in to the ECS using Internet Explorer 10 or 11, click **AltGr** twice on the VNC page to activate the page.
