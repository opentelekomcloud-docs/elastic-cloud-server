How Can I Change a Remote Login Port?
=====================================

Scenarios
---------

This section describes how to change a port for remote logins.

Windows
-------

The following procedure uses an ECS running Windows Server 2012 as an example. The default login port of a Windows ECS is 3389. To change it to port 2020, for example, do as follows:

#. In the **Run** dialog box, enter **regedit** to access the registry editor.

#. In **Registry Editor**, choose **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** > **SYSTEM** > **CurrentControlSet** > **Control** > **Terminal Server** > **Wds** > **rdpwd** > **Tds** > **tcp** and double-click **PortNumber**.

   a. In the dialog box that is displayed, set **Base** to **Decimal**.

   b. Change the value in **Value data** to the new port number, which is **2020** in this example.

#. In **Registry Editor**, choose **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** > **SYSTEM** > **CurrentControlSet** > **Control** > **Terminal Server** > **WinStations** > **RDP-Tcp** and double-click **PortNumber**.

   a. In the dialog box that is displayed, set **Base** to **Decimal**.

   b. Change the value in **Value data** to the new port number, which is **2020** in this example.

#. (Skip this step if the firewall is disabled.) Modify the inbound rules of the firewall.

   Choose **Control Panel** > **Windows Firewall** > **Advanced Settings** > **Inbound Rules** > **New Rule**.

   -  **Rule Type**: **Port**
   -  Protocol in **Protocol and Ports**: **TCP**
   -  Port in **Protocol and Ports**: **Specific local ports**, **2020** in this example
   -  **Action**: **Allow the connection**
   -  **Profile**: Default settings
   -  **Name**: **RDP-2020**

   After the configuration, refresh the page to view the new rule.

#. Modify the security group rule.

   Add an inbound rule in which **Protocol** is set to **TCP** and **Port Range** is set to **2020**.

   Use port 2020 to remotely log in to the ECS.

#. In the **Services** window, restart **Remote Desktop Services** or the ECS.

Linux
-----

The following procedure uses an ECS running CentOS 7.3 as an example. The default login port of a Linux ECS is 22. To change it to port 2020, for example, do as follows:

#. Run the following command to edit the sshd configuration file:

   **vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config**

#. Delete the comment tag (#) from the **#port 22** line and change **22** to **2020**.

#. Press **Esc** to exit the editing mode. Enter **:wq!** to save and exit the configuration.

#. Run either of the following commands to restart sshd:

   **service sshd restart**

   Or

   **systemctl restart sshd**

#. Skip this step if the firewall is disabled. Configure the firewall.

   The firewall varies depending on the CentOS version. CentOS 7 uses firewalld, and CentOS 6 uses iptables. The following operations use CentOS 7 as an example.

   Run the **firewall-cmd --state** command to check the firewall status.

   -  (Recommended) Method 1: Add information about a new port to firewalld.

      a. Run the following commands to add a rule for port 2020:

         **firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=2020/tcp --permanent**

         **firewall-cmd --reload**

      b. View the added port. The TCP connection of port 2020 will have been added.

         **firewall-cmd --list-all**

      c. Restart firewalld.

         **systemctl restart firewalld.service**

   -  Method 2: Disable the firewall and the function of automatically enabling the firewall upon ECS startup.

      **systemctl stop firewalld**

      **systemctl disable firewalld**

#. Modify the security group rule.

   Add an inbound rule in which **Protocol** is set to **TCP** and **Port Range** is set to **2020**.

   Use port 2020 to remotely log in to the ECS.
