Why Does a Blank Screen Appear While the System Displays a Message Indicating Successful Authentication After I Attempted to Log In to an ECS Using VNC?
========================================================================================================================================================

Another user has logged in to this ECS using VNC.

Only one user can log in to an ECS using VNC at a time. If multiple users attempt to log in to an ECS at the same time, only the first user can log in to it. For other users, the system displays a message indicating that the user is authenticated, but the screen turns blank. If this occurs, wait until the other user logs out of the ECS.
