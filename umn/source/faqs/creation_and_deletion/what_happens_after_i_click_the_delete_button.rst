What Happens After I Click the **Delete** Button?
=================================================

After you click **Delete**, the selected ECSs will be deleted. You can also choose to delete the EVS disks and EIPs together with the selected ECSs. If you do not delete them, they will be retained. If necessary, you can manually delete them later.

To delete selected ECSs, perform the following operations:

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. Select the ECSs to be deleted.

#. Above the ECS list, choose **Delete**.
