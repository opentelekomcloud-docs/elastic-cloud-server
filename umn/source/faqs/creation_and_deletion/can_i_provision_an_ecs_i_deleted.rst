Can I Provision an ECS I Deleted?
=================================

No. ECSs in the **Deleted** state cannot provide services and are soon removed from the system.

A deleted ECS is retained in the ECS list on the management console only for a short period of time before it is permanently removed from the system. You can create a new ECS with the same specifications again.
