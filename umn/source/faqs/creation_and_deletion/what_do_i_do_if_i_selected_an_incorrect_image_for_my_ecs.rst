What Do I Do If I Selected an Incorrect Image for My ECS?
=========================================================

You can change the image for your ECS on the ECS console.

#. Select the target ECS and click **Stop** in the upper left corner of the ECS list.

#. Locate the row that contains the target ECS and choose **More** > **Manage Image/Backup** > **Change OS** in the **Operation** column.

   The **Change OS** dialog box is displayed.

#. Select the target image type and image.

#. Set the login mode. You can select **Password** or **Key pair**.

#. Set the other parameters and click **OK**.

   After the application is submitted, the ECS status changes to **Changing OS**. The OS changing has been successfully completed when the ECS status changes to **Running**.

For details, see :ref:`Changing the OS <en-us_topic_0031523135>`.
