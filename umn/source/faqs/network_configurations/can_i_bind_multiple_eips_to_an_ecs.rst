Can I Bind Multiple EIPs to an ECS?
===================================

Scenarios
---------

You can bind multiple EIPs to an ECS. However, this configuration is not recommended.

To bind multiple EIPs to an ECS, you must manually configure routes.

Configuration Example
---------------------

:ref:`Table 1 <en-us_topic_0018073216__table10449199163243>` lists ECS configurations.

.. table:: **Table 1** ECS configurations

   ============= ================
   Parameter     Configuration
   ============= ================
   Name          ecs_test
   Image         CentOS 6.5 64bit
   EIP           2
   Primary NIC   eth0
   Secondary NIC eth1
   ============= ================

**Example 1:**

If you are required to access public network 11.11.11.0/24 through standby NIC **eth1**, perform the following operations to configure a route:

#. Log in to the ECS.

#. Run the following command to configure a route:

   **ip route add 11.11.11.0/24 dev eth1 via 192.168.2.1**

   In the preceding command, **192.168.2.1** is the gateway IP address of standby NIC **eth1**.

**Example 2:**

Based on example 1, if you are required to enable routing for default public network traffic through standby NIC **eth1**, perform the following operations to configure a route:

#. Log in to the ECS.

#. Run the following command to delete the default route:

   **ip route delete default**

#. Run the following command to configure a new default route:

   **ip route add 0.0.0.0/0 dev eth1 via 192.168.2.1**

   In the preceding command, **192.168.2.1** is the gateway IP address of standby NIC **eth1**.
