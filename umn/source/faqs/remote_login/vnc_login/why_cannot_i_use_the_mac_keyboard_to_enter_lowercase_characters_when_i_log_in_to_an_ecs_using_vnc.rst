Why Cannot I Use the MAC Keyboard to Enter Lowercase Characters When I Log In to an ECS Using VNC?
==================================================================================================

If you use the MAC keyboard to enter German characters on your computer running MAC OS, uppercase characters can be entered properly after **Caps Lock** is enabled. However, after **Caps Lock** is disabled, the entered characters are still uppercase.

To resolve this issue, hold **Shift** and press the letter key on the keyboard.
