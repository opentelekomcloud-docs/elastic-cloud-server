What Should I Do If the ECS Resources to Be Purchased Are Sold Out?
===================================================================

When you are purchasing ECSs, the selected specifications may be sold out. In this case, the specifications cannot be purchased in the current region or AZ.

Each region has multiple AZs. If resources in an AZ are sold out, you are advised to:

-  Switch to another AZ to purchase the resources.
-  Purchase other resources that are not sold out.
