What Is an AZ?
==============

AZ
--

An availability zone (AZ) is a physical region where resources use independent power supplies and networks. AZs are physically isolated but interconnected through an internal network.

There are multiple AZs in each region. If one AZ becomes faulty, other AZs in the same region continue to provide services.

AZs in the same region can communicate with each other through an internal network.

Selecting an AZ
---------------

You can select an AZ when you are purchasing an ECS. After the ECS is created, the AZ cannot be changed. If there is only one AZ displayed in a region, it means the region only provides one AZ.
