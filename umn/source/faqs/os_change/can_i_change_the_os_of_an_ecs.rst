Can I Change the OS of an ECS?
==============================

Yes, you can change the OS of an ECS.

If the OS running on an ECS cannot meet service requirements, for example, a higher OS version is required, you can change the ECS OS.

The cloud platform allows you to change the image type (public images, private images, and shared images) and OS. You can change the OS by changing the ECS image.

For instructions about how to change an ECS OS, see :ref:`Changing the OS <en-us_topic_0031523135>`.
