Passing User Data to ECSs
=========================

Scenarios
---------

Use the **User Data** function to pass user data to ECSs to:

-  Simplify ECS configuration.
-  Initialize the ECS OS configuration.
-  Upload your scripts to ECSs during ECS creation.
-  Perform other tasks using scripts.

Use Restrictions
----------------

-  Linux

   -  The image that is used to create ECSs must have Cloud-Init installed.

   -  The user data to be specified must be less than or equal to 32 KB.
   -  If user data is uploaded as text, the data can contain only ASCII characters. If user data is uploaded using a file, the file can contain any characters and the file size cannot exceed 32 KB.
   -  The image that is used to create ECSs must be a public image, a private image created based on a public image, or a private image with Cloud-Init installed.
   -  The format of the customized scripts must be supported by Linux ECSs.
   -  DHCP must be enabled on the VPC network, and port 80 must be enabled for the security group in the outbound direction.

-  Windows

   -  The image that is used to create ECSs must have Cloudbase-Init installed.
   -  The user data to be specified must be less than or equal to 32 KB.
   -  If user data is uploaded as text, the data can contain only ASCII characters. If user data is uploaded using a file, the file can contain any characters and the file size cannot exceed 32 KB.
   -  The image that is used to create ECSs must be a public image, a private image created based on a public image, or a private image with Cloudbase-Init installed.
   -  DHCP must be enabled on the VPC network, and port 80 must be enabled for the security group in the outbound direction.

Passing User Data
-----------------

#. Create a user data script, the format of which complies with user data script specifications. For details, see :ref:`Helpful Links <en-us_topic_0032380449__section54344118153243>`.

#. When creating an ECS, set **Advanced Options** to **Configure now**, and paste the content of the user data script to the **User Data** text box or upload the user data file.

   .. note::

      You can pass user data to an ECS as text or as a file.

      Text: Copy the content of the user data script to the text box.

      File: Save the user data script to a text file and then upload the file.

#. The created ECS automatically runs Cloud-Init/Cloudbase-Init and reads the user data script upon startup.

User Data Scripts of Linux ECSs
-------------------------------

Customized user data scripts of Linux ECSs are based on the open-source Cloud-Init architecture. This architecture uses ECS metadata as the data source for automatically configuring the ECSs. The customized script types are compatible with open-source Cloud-Init. For details about Cloud-Init, see http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/format.html.

-  Script execution time: A customized user data script is executed after the time when the status of the target ECS changes to **Running** and before the time when **/etc/init** is executed.

   .. note::

      By default, the scripts are executed as user **root**.

-  Script type: Both user-data scripts and Cloud-Config data scripts are supported.

-  How can I view the customized user data passed to a Linux ECS?

   #. Log in to the ECS.

   #. Run the following command to view the customized user data as user **root**:

      **curl http://169.254.169.254/openstack/latest/user_data**

-  Script usage examples

   This section describes how to inject scripts in different formats into Linux ECSs and view script execution results.

   **Example 1: Inject a user-data script.**

   When creating an ECS, set **User Data** to **As text** and enter the customized user data script.

   .. code-block::

      #!/bin/bash
      echo "Hello, the time is now $(date -R)" | tee /root/output.txt

   After the ECS is created, start it and run the **cat** *[file]* command to check the script execution result.

   .. code-block::

      [root@XXXXXXXX ~]# cat /root/output.txt
      Hello, the time is now Mon, 16 Jul 2016 16:03:18+0800

   **Example 2: Inject a Cloud-Config data script.**

   When creating an ECS, set **User Data** to **As text** and enter the customized user data script.

   .. code-block::

      #cloud-config
      bootcmd:
      - echo 192.168.1.130 us.archive.ubuntu.com >> /etc/hosts

   After the ECS is created, start it and run the **cat /etc/hosts** command to check the script execution result.

Case 1
------

This case illustrates how to use the user data passing function to simplify Linux ECS configuration.

In this example, vim is configured to enable syntax highlighting, display line numbers, and set the tab stop to **4**. The .vimrc configuration file is created and injected into the **/root/.vimrc** directory during ECS creation. After the ECS is created, vim is automatically configured based on your requirements. This improves ECS configuration efficiency, especially in batch ECS creation scenarios.

User data example:

.. code-block::

   #cloud-config
   write_files:
     - path: /root/.vimrc
       content: |
         syntax on
         set tabstop=4
         set number      

Case 2
------

This case illustrates how to use the user data passing function to set the password for logging in to a Linux ECS.

User data example:

-  Using a ciphertext password (recommended)

   .. code-block::

      #!/bin/bash 
      echo 'root:$6$V6azyeLwcD3CHlpY$BN3VVq18fmCkj66B4zdHLWevqcxlig' | chpasswd -e;

   In the preceding command output, **$6$V6azyeLwcD3CHlpY$BN3VVq18fmCkj66B4zdHLWevqcxlig** is the ciphertext password, which can be generated as follows:

   #. Run the following command to generate an encrypted ciphertext value:

      **python -c "import crypt, getpass, pwd;print crypt.mksalt()"**

      The following information is displayed:

      .. code-block::

         $6$V6azyeLwcD3CHlpY

   #. Run the following command to generate a ciphertext password based on the salt value:

      **python -c "import crypt, getpass, pwd;print crypt.crypt('Cloud.1234','\$6\$V6azyeLwcD3CHlpY')"**

      The following information is displayed:

      .. code-block::

         $6$V6azyeLwcD3CHlpY$BN3VVq18fmCkj66B4zdHLWevqcxlig

After the ECS is created, you can use the password to log in to it.

Case 3
------

This case illustrates how to use the user data passing function to reset the password for logging in to a Linux ECS.

In this example, the password of user **root** is reset to **\*****\***.

.. note::

   The new password must meet the password complexity requirements listed in :ref:`Table 4 <en-us_topic_0032380449__table580060101120>`.

User data example (Retain the indentation in the following script):

.. code-block::

   #cloud-config
   chpasswd:
     list: |
       root:******
     expire: False

After the ECS is created, you can use the reset password to log in to it. To ensure system security, change the password of user **root** after logging in to the ECS for the first time.

Case 4
------

This case illustrates how to use the user data passing function to create a user on a Windows ECS and configure the password for the user.

In this example, the user's username is **abc**, its password is **\*****\***, and the user is added to the **administrators** user group.

.. note::

   The new password must meet the password complexity requirements listed in :ref:`Table 4 <en-us_topic_0032380449__table580060101120>`.

User data example:

.. code-block::

   rem cmd
   net user abc ****** /add
   net localgroup administrators abc /add

After the ECS is created, you can use the created username and password to log in to it.

Case 5
------

This case illustrates how to use the user data passing function to update system software packages for a Linux ECS and enable the HTTPd service. After the user data is passed to an ECS, you can use the HTTPd service.

User data example:

.. code-block::

   #!/bin/bash
   yum update -y
   service httpd start
   chkconfig httpd on

Case 6
------

This case illustrates how to use the user data passing function to assign user **root** permission for remotely logging in to a Linux ECS. After passing the file to an ECS, you can log in to the ECS as user **root** using SSH key pair authentication.

User data example:

.. code-block::

   #cloud-config
   disable_root: false
   runcmd:
   - sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*$/PermitRootLogin without-password/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   - sed -i '/^KexAlgorithms.*$/d' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   - service sshd restart
