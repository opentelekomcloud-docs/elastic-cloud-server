Changing the OS
===============

Scenarios
---------

Changing an ECS OS will change the system disk attached to the ECS. After the changing, the system disk ID of the ECS will be changed, and the original system disk will be deleted.

If the OS running on an ECS cannot meet service requirements, change the ECS OS.

The public cloud supports changing between image types (public images, private images, and shared images) and between OSs. You can change your OS by changing your ECS image.

Constraints
-----------

-  The EVS disk quota must be greater than 0.
-  H2 ECSs do not support OS change.
-  If an ECS OS is to be changed using a full-ECS image, the ECS system disk can be encrypted.

Notes
-----

-  After the OS is changed, the original OS is not retained, and the original system disk is deleted, including the data in all partitions of the system disk.
-  Back up data before changing the OS. For details, see .
-  Changing the OS does not affect data in data disks.
-  After the OS is changed, your service running environment must be deployed in the new OS again.
-  After the OS is changed, the ECS will be automatically started.
-  After the OS is changed, the system disk type of the ECS cannot be changed.
-  After the OS is changed, the IP and MAC addresses of the ECS remain unchanged.
-  After the OS is changed, customized configurations, such as DNS and hostname of the original OS will be reset and require reconfiguration.
-  It takes about 10 to 20 minutes to change the OS. During this process, the ECS is in **Changing OS** state.
-  Do not perform any operations on the ECS immediately after its OS is changed. Wait for several minutes until the system successfully injects the password or key. Otherwise, the injection may fail, and the ECS cannot be logged in to.
-  After the OS is changed, the password for logging in to the ECS is reset. To retrieve the password, perform the following operations:

   -  For a Linux ECS, log in to it using the key and set a new password. For instructions about how to log in to an ECS using a key pair, see `Login Using an SSH Key <../../instances/logging_in_to_a_linux_ecs/login_using_an_ssh_key.html>`__.
   -  For a Windows ECS, retrieve the password by following the instructions provided in `Obtaining the Password for Logging In to a Windows ECS <../../passwords_and_key_pairs/obtaining_the_password_for_logging_in_to_a_windows_ecs.html>`__.

-  The system disk capacity of an ECS with OS changed may change because the system disk capacity specified by the image of the changed OS may be changed.
-  You can choose to encrypt the system disk of an ECS during OS change.

Notes on Change Between Different OSs
-------------------------------------

Change between different OSs indicates that the OS is changed between Windows and Linux.

-  To change Windows to Linux, install an NTFS partition tool, such as NTFS-3G for data reading and writing on the Windows ECS.
-  To change Linux to Windows, install software, such as Ext2Read or Ext2Fsd to identify ext3 or ext4.

   .. note::

      You are not advised to change Linux to Window on the cloud platform. The reason is as follows: If there are LVM partitions on the Linux ECS, these partitions may fail after the OS is changed to Windows.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  The target ECS is stopped.
-  The target ECS has a system disk attached.
-  Necessary data has been backed up. (Changing the OS clears the data in all partitions of the system disk, including the system partition.)
-  If the original ECS uses password authentication while the new ECS uses key pair authentication, ensure that a key pair is available.
-  If a private image is required for changing the ECS OS, create the desired private image by following the instructions provided in *Image Management Service User Guide*.

   -  If an ECS image is required, make sure that a private image has been created using the ECS.
   -  If a local image file is required, make sure that the image file has been imported to the cloud platform and registered as a private image.
   -  If a private image from another region is required, make sure that the image has been copied.
   -  If a private image from another user account is required, make sure that the image has been shared with you.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. Locate the row containing the target ECS. Click **More** in the **Operation** column and select **Manage Image/Disk** > **Change OS**.

   Only stopped ECSs support OS changing. If the ECS is not stopped, stop it before proceeding with changing.

#. Modify related ECS parameters, such as **Image Type** and **Image**, based on service requirements.

   For more details, see `Creating an ECS <../../getting_started/index.html>`__.

#. (Optional) Select the **Encryption** option to encrypt the system disk during OS change.

   To enable encryption, click **Create Xrole** to assign KMS access permissions to EVS. If you have rights granting permission, assign the KMS access permissions to EVS. If you do not have the permission, contact the user having the security administrator rights to assign the KMS access permissions. For more details, see `Can All Users Use the Encryption Feature? <../../faqs/disk_management/can_all_users_use_the_encryption_feature.html>`__

   Encryption parameters are as follows:

   -  **Encryption**: indicates that the EVS disk has been encrypted.
   -  **Create Xrole**: assigns KMS access permissions to EVS to obtain KMS keys. After the permissions are assigned, follow-up operations do not require assigning permissions again.
   -  **KMS Key Name**: specifies the name of the key used by the encrypted EVS disk. You can select an existing key, or click **Create KMS Key** and create a new one on the KMS console. The default value is **evs/default**.
   -  **Xrole Name: EVSAccessKMS**: specifies that permissions have been assigned to EVS to obtain KMS keys for encrypting or decrypting EVS disks.
   -  **KMS Key ID**: specifies the ID of the key used by the encrypted data disk.

#. (Optional) Select a **License Type** (**Use license from the system** or **Bring your own license (BYOL)**) if the changed OS running on your ECS is billed. For more details, see `License Type <../../service_overview/security/license_type.html>`__.

   The following OSs are billed:

   -  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
   -  Oracle Enterprise Linux
   -  Red Hat Enterprise Linux

#. Configure the login mode.

   If the target ECS uses key pair authentication, you can replace the original key pair.

#. Click **OK**.

#. On the **Change ECS OS** page, confirm the specifications, and click **Submit Application**.

   After the application is submitted, the ECS status changes to **Changing OS**. The OS changing has been completed when **Changing OS** disappears.

   .. note::

      A temporary ECS is created during the OS changing process. After the process is complete, this ECS will be automatically deleted.

Follow-up Procedure
-------------------

-  If the OSs before and after the OS change are both Linux, and automatic partition mounting upon system startup has been enabled for the data disk, the data disk partition mounting information will be lost after the OS is changed. In such a case, you need to update the **/etc/fstab** configuration.

   #. Write the new partition information into **/etc/fstab**.

      It is a good practice to back up the **/etc/fstab** file before writing data into it.

      To enable automatic partition mounting upon system startup, see `Initializing a Linux Data Disk (fdisk) <../../getting_started/initializing_evs_data_disks/initializing_a_linux_data_disk_(fdisk).html>`__.

   #. Mount the partition so that you can use the data disk.

      **mount** *Disk partition* *Device name*

   #. Check the mount result.

      **df -TH**

-  If the OS change is unsuccessful, perform steps `3 <#enustopic0031523135enustopic0031523135enustopic0024911405li45082966143628>`__ to `10 <#enustopic0031523135enustopic0031523135enustopic0024911405li45992498111556>`__ again to retry changing the OS again.
-  If the second OS change attempt is unsuccessful, contact customer service for manual recovery at the backend.
