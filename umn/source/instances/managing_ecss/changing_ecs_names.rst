Changing ECS Names
==================

Scenarios
---------

The name of a created ECS can be changed to meet your service requirements.

Multiple ECS names can be changed in a batch. After the change, the ECS names are the same.

Changing the Name of a Single ECS
---------------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. Click the name of the target ECS.

#. On the page providing details about the ECS, click |image2| next to the ECS name. Then, change the name as prompted.

   **Allow duplicate name**: allows ECS names to be duplicate. If **Allow duplicate name** is not selected and the new name you configure is the same as an existing ECS name, the system displays a message indicating that the name has been used and you need to change it to another name.

#. Click **OK**.

Changing the Names of Multiple ECSs in a Batch
----------------------------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image3| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. Select the target ECSs.

#. Click **More** above the ECS list and select **Change ECS Name** from the drop-down list.

#. Enter a new name.

#. Click **OK**.

   If you change ECS names in a batch, the new ECS names are the same, for example, all are **ecs-test**.
