Viewing ECS Creation Statuses
=============================

Scenarios
---------

After submitting the request for creating an ECS, you can view the creation status. This section describes how to view the creation status of an ECS.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.
#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.
#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.
#. After creating an ECS, view the creation status in the task status area on the right side of common operations (**Start**, **Stop**, and **More**).
#. Click the number displayed above **Creating** and view details about the tasks.

   .. note::

      -  An ECS that is being created is in one of the following states:

         -  **Creating**: The ECS is being created.

         -  **Failures**: Creating the ECS failed. In such a case, the system automatically rolls the task back and displays an error code on the GUI, for example, **Ecs.0013 Insufficient EIP quota**.

         -  **Running**: The request of creating the ECS has been processed, and the ECS is running properly. An ECS in this state can provide services for you.

            See :ref:`How Do I Handle Error Messages Displayed on the Management Console? <en-us_topic_0032398121>` for troubleshooting.

      -  If you find that the task status area shows an ECS creation failure but the ECS list displays the created ECS, see :ref:`Why Does the Failures Area Show an ECS Creation Failure But the ECS List Displays the Created ECS? <en-us_topic_0039524582>`
