============================

Scenarios

After obtaining ECSs, you can view and manage them on the management console. This section describes how to view detailed ECS configurations, including its name, image, system disk, data disks, VPC, NIC, security group, and EIP.

To view the private IP address of an ECS, view it on the **Elastic Cloud Server** page.

Procedure

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

   The **Elastic Cloud Server** page is displayed. On this page, you can view your ECSs and the basic information about the ECSs, such as their private IP addresses.

#. In the search box above the ECS list, enter the ECS name, IP address, or ID, and click |image2| for search. Alternatively, click **Search by Tag** above the upper right corner of the ECS list and search for an ECS by tag key and value.

#. Click the name of the target ECS.

   The page providing details about the ECS is displayed.
