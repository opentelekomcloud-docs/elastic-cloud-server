General Operations for Modifying Specifications
===============================================

Scenarios
---------

If ECS specifications do not meet service requirements, you can modify the ECS specifications, including vCPUs and memory. Certain ECSs allow you to change their types when you modify their specifications.

-  For instructions about how to modify the specifications of other ECSs, for example, between KVM ECSs, see this section.

Background
----------

To obtain the virtualization type of an ECS, perform the following operations:

#. On the page providing details about the ECS, view the ECS specifications.

#. Check the specifications tables in :ref:`ECS Types <en-us_topic_0035470096>` for the virtualization type.

Notes
-----

-  If ECS specifications are downgraded, the ECS performance will deteriorate.
-  Certain ECSs do not support specifications modification currently. For details about available ECS types as well as their functions and usage, see "Notes" in :ref:`ECS Types <en-us_topic_0035470096>`.
-  When the disk status is **Expanding**, you are not allowed to modify the specifications of the ECS where the disk is attached.
-  Before modifying the specifications of a Windows ECS, modify the SAN policy by following the instructions provided in :ref:`Why Does a Disk Attached to a Windows ECS Go Offline? <en-us_topic_0114225937>` to prevent disks from going offline after the specifications are modified.
-  Before modifying specifications, make sure that the ECS has been stopped.

Step 1: Modify Specifications
-----------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. On the **Elastic Cloud Server** page, view the status of the target ECS.

   If the ECS is not in **Stopped** state, click **More** in the **Operation** column and select **Stop**.

#. Click **More** in the **Operation** column and select **Modify Specifications**.

   The **Modify ECS Specifications** page is displayed.

#. Select the new ECS type, vCPUs, and memory as prompted.

#. (Optional) Set **DeH**.

   If the ECS is created on a DeH, the system allows you to change the DeH.

   To do so, select the target DeH from the drop-down list. If no DeH is available in the drop-down list, remaining DeH resources are insufficient and cannot be used to create the ECS with specifications modified.

#. Click **Next**.

#. On the **Modify ECS Specifications** page, confirm the modified vCPU and memory specifications and click **Submit**.

#. Check whether the specifications have been modified.

   After modifying the specifications, you can check whether the specifications have been modified in **Failures**.

   a. Check whether **Failures** is displayed on the management console. For details, see :ref:`Viewing Failures <en-us_topic_0108255889>`.

      -  If yes, go to step :ref:`10.b <en-us_topic_0013771092__li6253192246>`.
      -  If no, the specifications have been modified.

   b. .. _en-us_topic_0013771092__li6253192246:

      Click **Failures**. Then, in the **Failures** dialog box, click **Operation Failures** and check whether the task is contained in the list by **Name/ID**, **Operated At**, or **Task**.

      -  If yes, the specifications modification failed. See :ref:`Follow-up Procedure <en-us_topic_0013771092__section9461027528>` for failure causes.
      -  If no, the specifications have been modified.

Step 2: Check Disk Attachment
-----------------------------

After specifications are modified, disk attachment may fail. Therefore, check disk attachment after specifications modification. If disks are properly attached, the specifications modification is successful.

-  Windows ECS

   For details, see :ref:`Why Do the Disks of a Windows ECS Go Offline After I Modify the ECS Specifications? <en-us_topic_0214940105>`

-  Linux ECS

   For details, see :ref:`Why Does the Disk Attachment of a Linux ECS Fail After I Modify the ECS Specifications? <en-us_topic_0214940106>`

.. _en-us_topic_0013771092__section9461027528:

Follow-up Procedure
-------------------

Perform the following operations in the event of a specifications modification failure:

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, click **Cloud Trace Service**.

#. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Trace List**.

#. In the **Trace Name** column, locate the **resizeServer** event by resource ID.

   The resource ID is the ID of the ECS on which the specifications modification failed.

#. Click **View Trace** in the **Operation** column to view the failure cause.

   If the fault cannot be rectified based on logs, contact customer service.
