Inference-accelerated PI2
-------------------------

**Overview**

PI2 ECSs use NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs dedicated for real-time AI inference. These ECSs use the T4 INT8 calculator for up to 130 TOPS of INT8 computing. The PI2 ECSs can also be used for light-load training.

**PI2 ECS Features**

-  CPU: 2nd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable 6278 processors (2.6 GHz of base frequency and 3.5 GHz of turbo frequency), or Intel® Xeon® Scalable 6151 processors (3.0 GHz of base frequency and 3.4 GHz of turbo frequency)
-  Up to four NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs on an ECS
-  GPU hardware passthrough
-  Up to 8.1 TFLOPS of single-precision computing on a single GPU
-  Up to 130 TOPS of INT8 computing on a single GPU
-  16 GiB of GDDR6 GPU memory with a bandwidth of 320 GiB/s on a single GPU
-  One built-in NVENC and two NVDEC GPUs

**Supported Common Software**

PI2 ECSs are used in GPU-based inference computing scenarios, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The PI2 ECSs can also be used for light-load training.

PI2 ECSs support the following commonly used software:

-  Deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, and MXNet

**Notes**

-  After a PI2 ECS is stopped, basic resources including vCPUs, memory, and images are not billed, but its system disk is billed based on the disk capacity. If other products, such as EVS disks, EIP, and bandwidth are associated with the ECS, these products are billed separately.\ |image4|

   Resources are released after a PI2 ECS is stopped. If desired resources are insufficient when the PI2 ECS is started after being stopped, starting the ECS might fail. Therefore, if you need to use a PI2 ECS for a long time, keep the ECS running.

-  PI2 ECSs support the following OSs:

   -  Windows Server 2019 Standard 64bit
   -  Windows Server 2016 Standard 64bit
   -  Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard 64bit
   -  Ubuntu Server 16.04 64bit
   -  CentOS 7.8 64bit

-  PI2 ECSs support automatic recovery when the hosts accommodating such ECSs become faulty.
-  By default, PI2 ECSs created using a Windows public image have the Tesla driver installed.
-  By default, PI2 ECSs created using a Linux public image do not have a Tesla driver installed. After the ECS is created, install a driver on it for computing acceleration. For details, see `Installing a Tesla Driver and CUDA Toolkit on a GPU-accelerated ECS <instances/(optional)_installing_a_driver_and_toolkit/installing_a_tesla_driver_and_cuda_toolkit_on_a_gpu-accelerated_ecs>`__.
-  If a PI2 ECS is created using a private image, make sure that the Tesla driver was installed during the private image creation. If not, install the driver for computing acceleration after the ECS is created. For details, see `Installing a Tesla Driver and CUDA Toolkit on a GPU-accelerated ECS <instances/(optional)_installing_a_driver_and_toolkit/installing_a_tesla_driver_and_cuda_toolkit_on_a_gpu-accelerated_ecs>`__.
