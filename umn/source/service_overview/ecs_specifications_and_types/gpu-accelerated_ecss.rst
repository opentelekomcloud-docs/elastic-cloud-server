GPU-accelerated ECSs
====================

GPU-accelerated ECSs provide outstanding floating-point computing capabilities. They are suitable for applications that require real-time, highly concurrent massive computing.

GPU-accelerated ECSs are classified as G series and P series of ECSs.

-  G series: Graphics-accelerated ECSs, which are suitable for 3D animation rendering and CAD
-  P series: Computing-accelerated or inference-accelerated ECSs, which are suitable for deep learning, scientific computing, and CAE

**Notes**

-  The system disk of a P2 ECS must be greater than or equal to 15 GiB. It is recommended that the system disk be greater than 40 GiB.

-  The local NVMe SSDs attached to P2 ECSs are dedicated for services with strict requirements on storage I/O performance, such as deep learning training and HPC. Local disks are attached to the ECSs of specified flavors and cannot be separately bought. In addition, you are not allowed to detach a local disk and then attach it to another ECS.

   .. note::

      Data may be lost on the local NVMe SSDs attached to P2 ECSs due to a fault, for example, due to a disk or host fault. Therefore, you are suggested to store only temporary data in local NVMe SSDs. If you store important data in such a disk, securely back up the data.

-  P2 ECSs do not support specifications modification.

**P1 ECS Features**

-  CPU: Intel速 Xeon速 E5-2690 v4 processors (2.6 GHz of base frequency and 3.5 GHz of turbo frequency)

-  Up to four NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs on a P1 ECS (If eight P100 GPUs are required on an instance, use BMS.)

-  GPU hardware passthrough

-  9.3 TFLOPS of single-precision computing and 4.7 TFLOPS of double-precision computing

-  Maximum network bandwidth of 10 Gbit/s

-  16 GiB of HBM2 GPU memory with a bandwidth of 732 Gbit/s

-  800 GiB NVMe SSDs for temporary local storage

-  Comprehensive basic capabilities

   -  User-defined network with flexible subnet division and network access policy configuration
   -  Mass storage, elastic expansion, and backup and restoration
   -  Elastic scaling

-  Flexibility

   Similar to other types of ECSs, P1 ECSs can be provisioned in a few minutes. You can configure specifications as needed. P1 ECSs with two, four, and eight GPUs will be supported later.

-  Excellent supercomputing ecosystem

   The supercomputing ecosystem allows you to build up a flexible, high-performance, cost-effective computing platform. A large number of HPC applications and deep-learning frameworks can run on P1 ECSs.

**Supported Common Software**

P1 ECSs are used in computing acceleration scenarios, such as deep learning training, inference, scientific computing, molecular modeling, and seismic analysis. If the software requires GPU CUDA parallel computing, use P1 ECSs. P1 ECSs support the following commonly used software:

-  Deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, and MXNet
-  RedShift for Autodesk 3dsMax, V-Ray for 3ds Max
-  Agisoft PhotoScan
-  MapD

**Notes**

-  It is recommended that the system disk of a P1 ECS be greater than 40 GiB.

-  The local NVMe SSDs attached to P1 ECSs are dedicated for services with strict requirements on storage I/O performance, such as deep learning training and HPC. Local disks are attached to the ECSs of specified flavors and cannot be separately bought. In addition, you are not allowed to detach a local disk and then attach it to another ECS.

   .. note::

      Data may be lost on the local NVMe SSDs attached to P1 ECSs due to a fault, for example, due to a disk or host fault. Therefore, you are suggested to store only temporary data in local NVMe SSDs. If you store important data in such a disk, securely back up the data.

-  After a P1 ECS is created, you must install the NVIDIA driver for computing acceleration. For details, see :ref:`Installing a Tesla Driver and CUDA Toolkit on a GPU-accelerated ECS <en-us_topic_0149470468>`.

-  P1 ECSs do not support specifications change.

-  P1 ECSs do not support automatic recovery.

   -  If the host is faulty or subhealthy, you need to stop the ECS for hardware repair.
   -  In case of system maintenance or hardware faults, the ECS will be redeployed (to ensure HA) and cold migrated to another host. The local disk data of the ECS will not be retained.

-  After you delete a P1 ECS, the data stored in local NVMe SSDs is automatically cleared.

-  By default, P1 ECSs created using a Windows public image have the Tesla driver installed.

-  By default, P1 ECSs created using a Linux public image do not have a Tesla driver installed. After the ECS is created, install a driver on it for computing acceleration. For details, see :ref:`Installing a Tesla Driver and CUDA Toolkit on a GPU-accelerated ECS <en-us_topic_0149470468>`.

-  If a P1 ECS is created using a private image, make sure that the Tesla driver was installed during the private image creation. If not, install the driver for computing acceleration after the ECS is created. For details, see :ref:`Installing a Tesla Driver and CUDA Toolkit on a GPU-accelerated ECS <en-us_topic_0149470468>`.

**Pi2 ECS Features**

-  CPU: 2nd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Scalable 6278 processors (2.6 GHz of base frequency and 3.5 GHz of turbo frequency), or Intel速 Xeon速 Scalable 6151 processors (3.0 GHz of base frequency and 3.4 GHz of turbo frequency)
-  Up to four NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs on an ECS
-  GPU hardware passthrough
-  Up to 8.1 TFLOPS of single-precision computing on a single GPU
-  Up to 130 TOPS of INT8 computing on a single GPU
-  16 GiB of GDDR6 GPU memory with a bandwidth of 320 GiB/s on a single GPU
-  One NVENC engine and two NVDEC engines embedded

**Supported Common Software**

Pi2 ECSs are used in GPU-based inference computing scenarios, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The Pi2 ECSs can also be used for light-load training.

Pi2 ECSs support the following commonly used software:

-  Deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, and MXNet

**Notes**

-  After a Pi2 ECS is stopped, basic resources including vCPUs, memory, image, and GPUs are not billed, but its system disk is billed based on the disk capacity. If other products, such as EVS disks, EIP, and bandwidth are associated with the ECS, these products are billed separately.

   .. note::

      Resources are released after a Pi2 ECS is stopped. If resources are insufficient when the Pi2 ECS is started after being stopped, starting the ECS might fail. Therefore, if you need to use a Pi2 ECS for a long time, keep the ECS running.
