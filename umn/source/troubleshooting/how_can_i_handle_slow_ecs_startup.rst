How Can I Handle Slow ECS Startup?
==================================

If an ECS requires a long period of time to start, you can change the default timeout to speed up the startup.

#. Log in to the ECS.

#. Run the following command to switch to user **root**:

   **sudo su**

#. Run the following command to obtain the grub version:

   **rpm -qa \| grep grub**

#. Change the timeout in the grub file to 0s.

   -  If the grub version is earlier than 2:

      Open the **/boot/grub/grub.cfg** or **/boot/grub/menu.lst** file and change the **timeout** value to **0**.

   -  If the grub version is 2:

      Open the **/boot/grub2/grub.cfg** file and change the **timeout** value to **0**.
