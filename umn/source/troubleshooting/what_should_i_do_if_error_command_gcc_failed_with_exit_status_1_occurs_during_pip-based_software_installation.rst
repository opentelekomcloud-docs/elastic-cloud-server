What Should I Do If Error "command ´gcc´ failed with exit status 1" Occurs During PIP-based Software Installation
=================================================================================================================

Symptom
-------

When installing the Python library software, you need to configure the PIP source. Take the official image source as an example:

.. code-block::

   [root@test home]# cat /root/.pip/pip.conf 
   [global]
   index-url = https://pypi.python.org/simple
   trusted-host = pypi.python.org

During the installation, the system displays the message "command ´gcc´ failed with exit status 1". However, GCC has been installed by running the yum command before the Python library software is installed using the PIP.

   **Figure 1** Installation error

Possible Causes
---------------

openssl-devel is not supported.

Solution
--------

The following operations use psutil as an example:

#. Run the following command to install openssl-devel:

   **yum install gcc libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel -y**

#. Use PIP to install the Python library software again. The error message is cleared.
