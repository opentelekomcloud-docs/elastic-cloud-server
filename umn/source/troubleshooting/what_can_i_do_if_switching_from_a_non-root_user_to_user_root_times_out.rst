   **Figure 1** Connection timeout

Solution
--------

#. Log in to the ECS.

#. Run the following command to edit the hosts configuration file:

   **vi /etc/hosts**

#. Press **i** to enter editing mode.

#. Add the IP address and hostname to the last line of the hosts configuration file.

   *Private IP address hostname*

   An example is provided as follows:

   If the ECS hostname is **hostname** and the private IP address of the ECS is 192.168.0.1, add the following statement:

   192.168.0.1 hostname

#. Press **Esc** to exit editing mode.

#. Run the following command to save the configuration and exit:

   **:wq**

.. note::

   To update the hostname of an Ubuntu or Debian ECS, set the value of parameter **manage_etc_hosts** in the **/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg** file to **false** and update the new hostname in the **/etc/hosts** file. When editing the **/etc/hosts** file, do not delete the statement in the line where **127.0.0.1** is located. Otherwise, switching from a non-root user to user **root** will time out.
