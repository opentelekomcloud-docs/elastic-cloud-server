What Should I Do If Packages Are Downloaded Using PIP or wget at a Low Rate?
============================================================================

Symptom
-------

When a user runs the wget command to download software packages, the download rate is far less than the bandwidth.

Possible Causes
---------------

The official PIP website is accessed using HTTPS. Each time PIP is used to install a third-party Python module, the source code package must be downloaded at the official PIP website. Therefore, openssl packages are required.

Solution
--------

Run the following command to install openssl packages:

**yum install openssl openssl-devel**
