Initializing a Linux Data Disk (parted)
=======================================

Scenarios
---------

This section uses CentOS 7.4 64bit to describe how to initialize a data disk attached to a server running Linux and use parted to partition the data disk.

The maximum disk capacity supported by MBR is 2 TB, and that supported by GPT is 18 EB. Therefore, use the GPT partition style if your disk capacity is larger than 2 TB. In Linux, if you choose to use the GPT partition style, the fdisk partitioning tool cannot be used. Use the parted partitioning tool instead. For details about disk partition styles, see :ref:`Scenarios and Disk Partitions <en-us_topic_0030831623>`.

The method for initializing a disk varies depending on the OS running on the server. This document is used for reference only. For the detailed operations and differences, see the product documents of the corresponding OS.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  A data disk has been attached to a server and has not been initialized.
-  You have logged in to the server.

   -  For how to log in to an ECS, see the *Elastic Cloud Server User Guide*.
   -  For how to log in to a BMS, see the *Bare Metal Server User Guide*.

Creating and Mounting a Partition
---------------------------------

The following example shows you how a new partition can be created on a new data disk that has been attached to a server. The partition will be created using parted, and GPT is used as the partition style. Furthermore, the partition will be formatted using the ext4 file system, mounted on **/mnt/sdc**, and configured automatic mounting at system start.

#. Run the following command to query information about the new data disk:

   **lsblk**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# lsblk
      NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
      vda    253:0    0   40G  0 disk
      └─vda1 253:1    0   40G  0 part /
      vdb    253:16   0  100G  0 disk

   In the command output, the server contains two disks. **/dev/vda** is the system disk, and **/dev/vdb** is the new data disk.

#. Run the following command to enter parted to partition the new data disk:

   **parted** *New data disk*

   In this example, run the following command:

   **parted /dev/vdb**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      [root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# parted /dev/vdb
      GNU Parted 3.1
      Using /dev/vdb
      Welcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.
      (parted) 

#. Enter **p** and press **Enter** to view the current disk partition style.

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      (parted) p
      Error: /dev/vdb: unrecognised disk label
      Model: Virtio Block Device (virtblk)
      Disk /dev/vdb: 107GB
      Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
      Partition Table: unknown
      Disk Flags:
      (parted) 

   In the command output, the **Partition Table** value is **unknown**, indicating that no partition style is set for the new disk.

#. Run the following command to set the disk partition style:

   **mklabel** *Disk partition style*

   In this example, run the following command to set the partition style to GPT: (Disk partition styles can be MBR or GPT.)

   **mklabel gpt**

   .. important::

      The maximum disk capacity supported by MBR is 2 TB, and that supported by GPT is 18 EB. Because a data disk currently supports up to 32 TB, use the GPT partition style if your disk capacity is larger than 2 TB.

      If you change the disk partition style after the disk has been used, the data on the disk will be cleared. Therefore, select a proper disk partition style when initializing the disk.

#. Enter **p** and press **Enter** to view the disk partition style.

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      (parted) mklabel gpt
      (parted) p
      Model: Virtio Block Device (virtblk)
      Disk /dev/vdb: 107GB
      Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
      Partition Table: gpt
      Disk Flags:

      Number  Start  End  Size  File system  Name  Flags

      (parted) 

   In the command output, the **Partition Table** value is **gpt**, indicating that the disk partition style is GPT.

#. Enter **unit s** and press **Enter** to set the measurement unit of the disk to sector.

#. Run the following command and press **Enter**:

   **mkpart** *Partition name Start sector* *End sector*

   In this example, run the following command:

   **mkpart test 2048s 100%**

   In this example, one partition is created for the new data disk. Variable *2048s* indicates the disk start sector, and variable *100%* indicates the disk end sector. The two values are used for reference only. You can determine the number of partitions and the partition size based on your service requirements.

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      (parted) mkpart opt 2048s 100%
      (parted)

#. Enter **p** and press **Enter** to view details about the new partition.

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      (parted) p
      Model: Virtio Block Device (virtblk)
      Disk /dev/vdb: 209715200s
      Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B

      (parted) 

#. Enter **q** and press **Enter** to exit parted.

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      (parted) q
      Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.

   You can set automatic disk mounting by updating the **/etc/fstab** file. Before updating the file, set the file system format for the partition and mount the partition on the mount point.

#. Run the following command to view the disk partition information:

   **lsblk**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      [root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# lsblk
      NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
      vda    253:0    0   40G  0 disk
      └─vda1 253:1    0   40G  0 part /
      vdb    253:16   0  100G  0 disk
      └─vdb1 253:17   0  100G  0 part

   In the command output, **/dev/vdb1** is the partition you created.

#. Run the following command to set the file system format for the new partition:

   **mkfs** **-t** *File system format* **/dev/vdb1**

   In this example, run the following command to set the **ext4** file system for the new partition:

   **mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vdb1**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

   The formatting takes a period of time. Observe the system running status and do not exit.

   .. important::

      The partition sizes supported by file systems vary. Therefore, you are advised to choose an appropriate file system based on your service requirements.

#. Run the following command to create a mount point:

   **mkdir** *Mount point*

   In this example, run the following command to create the **/mnt/sdc** mount point:

   **mkdir /mnt/sdc**

#. Run the following command to mount the new partition on the created mount point:

   **mount** *Disk partition* *Mount point*

   In this example, run the following command to mount the new partition **/dev/vdb1** on **/mnt/sdc**:

   **mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/sdc**

#. Run the following command to view the mount result:

   **df -TH**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      [root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# df -TH

      /dev/vdb1      ext4      106G   63M  101G   1% /mnt/sdc

   New partition **/dev/vdb1** is mounted on **/mnt/sdc**.

   .. note::

      If the server is restarted, the mounting will become invalid. You can set automatic mounting for partitions at system start by modifying the **/etc/fstab** file. For details, see :ref:`Setting Automatic Mounting at System Start <en-us_topic_0085634798__en-us_topic_0084935709_section15839912195453>`.

Setting Automatic Mounting at System Start
------------------------------------------

Modify the **fstab** file to set automatic disk mounting at server start. You can also set automatic mounting for the servers containing data. This operation will not affect the existing data.

The following procedure shows how to set automatic disk mounting at server start by using UUIDs to identify disks in the **fstab** file. You are advised not to use device names to identify disks in the file because a device name may change (for example, from /dev/vdb1 to /dev/vdb2) during the server stop or start, resulting in improper server running after restart.

.. note::

   UUID is the unique character string for disk partitions in a Linux system.

#. Run the following command to query the partition UUID:

   **blkid** *Disk partition*

   In this example, run the following command to query the UUID of the **/dev/vdb1** partition:

   **blkid /dev/vdb1**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      [root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# blkid /dev/vdb1
      /dev/vdb1: UUID="0b3040e2-1367-4abb-841d-ddb0b92693df" TYPE="ext4"

   The UUID of the **/dev/vdb1** partition is displayed.

#. Run the following command to open the **fstab** file using the vi editor:

   **vi /etc/fstab**

#. Press **i** to enter the editing mode.

#. Move the cursor to the end of the file and press **Enter**. Then, add the following information:

   .. code-block::

      UUID=0b3040e2-1367-4abb-841d-ddb0b92693df /mnt/sdc                ext4    defaults        0 2

#. Press **Esc**, enter **:wq**, and press **Enter**.

   The system saves the configurations and exits the vi editor.

#. Perform the following operations to verify the automatic mounting function:

   a. Run the following command to unmount the partition:

      **umount** *Disk partition*

      In this example, run the following command:

      **umount /dev/vdb1**

   b. Run the following command to reload all the content in the **/etc/fstab** file:

      **mount -a**

   c. Run the following command to query the file system mounting information:

      **mount** **\|** **grep** *Mount point*

      In this example, run the following command:

      **mount** **\|** **grep** **/mnt/sdc**

      If information similar to the following is displayed, the automatic mounting function takes effect:

      .. code-block::

         root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# mount | grep /mnt/sdc
         /dev/vdb1 on /mnt/sdc type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
