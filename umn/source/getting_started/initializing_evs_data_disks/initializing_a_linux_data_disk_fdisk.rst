Initializing a Linux Data Disk (fdisk)
======================================

Scenarios
---------

This section uses CentOS 7.4 64bit to describe how to initialize a data disk attached to a server running Linux and use fdisk to partition the data disk.

The maximum disk capacity supported by MBR is 2 TB, and that supported by GPT is 18 EB. Therefore, use the GPT partition style if your disk capacity is larger than 2 TB. In Linux, if you choose to use the GPT partition style, the fdisk partitioning tool cannot be used. Use the parted partitioning tool instead. For details about disk partition styles, see :ref:`Scenarios and Disk Partitions <en-us_topic_0030831623>`.

The method for initializing a disk varies depending on the OS running on the server. This document is used for reference only. For the detailed operations and differences, see the product documents of the corresponding OS.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  A data disk has been attached to a server and has not been initialized.
-  You have logged in to the server.

   -  For how to log in to an ECS, see the *Elastic Cloud Server User Guide*.
   -  For how to log in to a BMS, see the *Bare Metal Server User Guide*.

Creating and Mounting a Partition
---------------------------------

The following example shows you how a new primary partition can be created on a new data disk that has been attached to a server. The primary partition will be created using fdisk, and MBR is the default partition style. Furthermore, the partition will be formatted using the ext4 file system, mounted on **/mnt/sdc**, and configured with automatic mounting at system start.

#. Run the following command to query information about the new data disk:

   **fdisk -l**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      [root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# fdisk -l

      Disk /dev/vda: 42.9 GB, 42949672960 bytes, 83886080 sectors
      Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
      Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
      I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
      Disk label type: dos
      Disk identifier: 0x000bcb4e

         Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
      /dev/vda1   *        2048    83886079    41942016   83  Linux

      Disk /dev/vdb: 107.4 GB, 107374182400 bytes, 209715200 sectors
      Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
      Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
      I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

   In the command output, the server contains two disks. **/dev/vda** is the system disk, and **/dev/vdb** is the new data disk.

#. Run the following command to enter fdisk to partition the new data disk:

   **fdisk** *New data disk*

   In this example, run the following command:

   **fdisk /dev/vdb**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      [root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# fdisk /dev/vdb
      Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.23.2).

      Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.

      Command (m for help):

      Command (m for help): n
      Partition type:
         p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
         e   extended

   There are two types of disk partitions:

   -  Choosing **p** creates a primary partition.
   -  Choosing **e** creates an extended partition.

   .. note::

      If the MBR partition style is used, a maximum of 4 primary partitions, or 3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition can be created. The extended partition cannot be used directly and must be divided into logical partitions before use.

      Disk partitions created using GPT are not categorized.

#. In this example, a primary partition is created. Therefore, enter **p** and press **Enter** to create a primary partition.

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      Partition number (1-4, default 1): 

   **Partition number** indicates the serial number of the primary partition. The value ranges from **1** to **4**.

#. Enter the serial number of the primary partition and press **Enter**. Primary partition number **1** is used in this example. One usually starts with partition number **1** when partitioning an empty disk.

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

#. Select the default start sector **2048** and press **Enter**.

   The system displays the start and end sectors of the partition's available space. You can customize the value within this range or use the default value. The start sector must be smaller than the partition's end sector.

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

   **Last sector** indicates the end sector. The value ranges from **2048** to **209715199**, and the default value is **209715199**.

#. Select the default end sector **209715199** and press **Enter**.

   The system displays the start and end sectors of the partition's available space. You can customize the value within this range or use the default value. The start sector must be smaller than the partition's end sector.

   .. important::

      The partition sizes supported by file systems vary. Therefore, you are advised to choose an appropriate file system based on your service requirements.

#. Run the following command to create a mount point:

   **mkdir** *Mount point*

   In this example, run the following command to create the **/mnt/sdc** mount point:

   **mkdir /mnt/sdc**

#. Run the following command to mount the new partition on the created mount point:

   **mount** *Disk partition* *Mount point*

   In this example, run the following command to mount the new partition **/dev/vdb1** on **/mnt/sdc**:

   **mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/sdc**

#. Run the following command to view the mount result:

   **df -TH**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   New partition **/dev/vdb1** is mounted on **/mnt/sdc**.

   .. note::

      If the server is restarted, the mounting will become invalid. You can set automatic mounting for partitions at system start by modifying the **/etc/fstab** file. For details, see :ref:`Setting Automatic Mounting at System Start <en-us_topic_0085634797__en-us_topic_0044524669_section15839912195453>`.

Setting Automatic Mounting at System Start
------------------------------------------

Modify the **fstab** file to set automatic disk mounting at server start. You can also set automatic mounting for the servers containing data. This operation will not affect the existing data.

The following procedure shows how to set automatic disk mounting at server start by using UUIDs to identify disks in the **fstab** file. You are advised not to use device names to identify disks in the file because a device name may change (for example, from /dev/vdb1 to /dev/vdb2) during the server stop or start, resulting in improper server running after restart.

.. note::

   UUID is the unique character string for disk partitions in a Linux system.

#. Run the following command to query the partition UUID:

   **blkid** *Disk partition*

   In this example, run the following command to query the UUID of the **/dev/vdb1** partition:

   **blkid /dev/vdb1**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      [root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# blkid /dev/vdb1
      /dev/vdb1: UUID="0b3040e2-1367-4abb-841d-ddb0b92693df" TYPE="ext4"

   The UUID of the **/dev/vdb1** partition is displayed.

#. Run the following command to open the **fstab** file using the vi editor:

   **vi /etc/fstab**

#. Press **i** to enter the editing mode.

#. Move the cursor to the end of the file and press **Enter**. Then, add the following information:

   .. code-block::

      UUID=0b3040e2-1367-4abb-841d-ddb0b92693df /mnt/sdc                ext4    defaults        0 2

#. Press **Esc**, enter **:wq**, and press **Enter**.

   The system saves the configurations and exits the vi editor.

#. Perform the following operations to verify the automatic mounting function:

   a. Run the following command to unmount the partition:

      **umount** *Disk partition*

      In this example, run the following command:

      **umount /dev/vdb1**

   b. Run the following command to reload all the content in the **/etc/fstab** file:

      **mount -a**

   c. Run the following command to query the file system mounting information:

      **mount** **\|** **grep** *Mount point*

      In this example, run the following command:

      **mount** **\|** **grep** **/mnt/sdc**

      If information similar to the following is displayed, the automatic mounting function takes effect:

      .. code-block::

         root@ecs-test-0001 ~]# mount | grep /mnt/sdc
         /dev/vdb1 on /mnt/sdc type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
