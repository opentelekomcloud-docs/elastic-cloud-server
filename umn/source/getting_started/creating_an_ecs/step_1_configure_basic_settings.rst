Step 1: Configure Basic Settings
================================

Accessing the ECS Creation Page
-------------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. Click **Create ECS**.

   The page for creating ECSs is displayed.

   .. note::

      SAP High-Performance Analytic Appliance (HANA) is a high-performance real-time data computing platform based on memory computing technologies. The public cloud provides high-performance IaaS services that comply with SAP HANA requirements. These services help you rapidly request for SAP HANA resources (such as applying for HANA ECSs and public IP addresses) and install and configure SAP HANA, therefore improving your operation efficiency, reducing operation costs, and enhancing your experience.

      HANA ECSs are dedicated for SAP HANA. If you want to deploy SAP HANA on cloud servers, create HANA ECSs.

      For more information about HANA ECS application scenarios and creation methods, see *SAP HANA User Guide*.

Performing Basic Configurations
-------------------------------

#. Select an AZ.

   An AZ is a physical location that uses independent power supply and networks. AZs in the same region can communicate with each other over an intranet.

   -  To enhance application availability, create ECSs in different AZs.
   -  To shorten network latency, create ECSs in the same AZ.

   .. note::

      Random AZ allocation is available on the console when you create an ECS. The system will use a hash algorithm to select a default AZ based on your universally unique identifier (UUID).

      The released ECS types and flavors vary depending on AZs. To view all supported ECS types and flavors on the cloud service platform, set **AZ** to **Random**. Then, the system automatically allocates an AZ according to your selected ECS flavor.

      For example, S3 ECSs are available only in AZ 1; S2 ECSs are available in AZ 2 and AZ 3 and have been sold out in AZ 1. If you set **AZ** to **Random**, you can view both S3 and S2 ECSs. If you create an S3 ECS, the system automatically allocates it to AZ 1. If you create an S2 ECS, the system randomly allocates it to AZ 2 or AZ 3.

#. Set **DeH**.

   This configuration is optional. This parameter is available only when you click **Create ECS** on the **Dedicated Host** page. It is unavailable when you click **Create ECS** on the **Elastic Cloud Server** page.

   DeH refers to physical server resources dedicated for a specified user. You can deploy ECSs on DeHs for better isolation, security, and performance of your ECSs. You can continue using your existing server software licenses of ECSs on DeHs to reduce costs. For more details, see *Dedicated Host User Guide*.

   .. note::

      If you select a SUSE-SAP public image when creating an ECS on a DeH, you will be billed for the license.

#. Set **Specifications**.

   The public cloud provides various ECS types for different application scenarios. You can choose from existing ECS types and flavors in the list. Alternatively, you can enter a flavor (such as c3) or specify vCPUs and memory size to search for the flavor suited to your needs.

   **Latest generation** shows the types and flavors of newly released ECSs, and **All generations** show the types and flavors of all ECSs provided by the public cloud.

   .. note::

      -  Before selecting an ECS type, learn the introduction and notes on each type of ECSs. For details, see :ref:`ECS Types <en-us_topic_0035470096>`.

      -  **Local Disk**: specifies the local storage of the physical server where the ECS is deployed. Only Hard Disk Driver (HDD) disks are supported. If the ECS of the selected type (such as **Disk-intensive**) uses local disks, the system automatically attaches the local disks to the ECS and displays the information of the local disks.

         For example, if **Local Disk** is **3x1800 GiB (HDD)**, three HDDs are attached to the ECS and the capacity of each HDD is 1800 GiB.

#. Select an image.

   -  Public image

      A public image is a standard, widely used image. It contains an OS and preinstalled public applications and is available to all users. You can configure the runtime environment or software in the public image as needed.

      If you select a SUSE-SAP public image, you will be billed for the license.

      For more information about public images, see `Public Images Introduction <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/ims/index.html>`__.

   -  Private image

      A private image is an image available only to the user who created it. It contains an OS, preinstalled public applications, and the user's private applications. Using a customized private image, you can create ECSs tailored to your needs in batches.

      You can also select an encrypted image. For details, see *Image Management Service User Guide*.

      .. note::

         -  If you use a full-ECS image to create an ECS, the EVS disks associated with the full-ECS image do not support the function of creating disks using a data disk image.

         -  If a full-ECS image is in **Normal** state and the system displays message "Available in AZ\ *x*", the full-ECS image can be used to create ECSs in this AZ only, and the encryption attributes of the system and data disks of the created ECSs are the same as those of the system and data disks specified in the full-ECS image. Additionally, the SCSI, sharing attribute, and data encryption settings of the system and data disks cannot be modified during ECS creation.

         -  If a full-ECS image is in **Normal** state but the system does not display message "Available in AZ\ *x*", the full-ECS image can be used to create ECSs in the entire region, and the encryption attributes of the system and data disks of the created ECSs are the same as those of the system and data disks specified in the full-ECS image. Additionally, the data encryption settings of the system disk, and the SCSI, sharing attribute, and data encryption settings of data disks can be modified during ECS creation.

         -  To ensure that NIC multi-queue is enabled on an ECS created using a private image, configure NIC multi-queue when creating such a private image. NIC multi-queue routes NIC interrupt requests among multiple vCPUs for higher network PPS and bandwidth.

            For details, see "How Do I Set NIC Multi-Queue Feature of an Image?"

   -  Shared image

      A shared image is a private image shared by another user.

#. (Optional) Set **License Type**.

   Specifies a license type for using an OS or software. This parameter is displayed only when the selected image is billed.

   -  Using License from the System

      Allows you to use the license provided by the public cloud platform. Obtaining the authorization of such a license is billed.

   -  Bring your own license (BYOL)

      Allows you to use your existing OS license. In such a case, you do not need to apply for a license again.

   For more details, see :ref:`License Type <en-us_topic_0046566932>`.

#. Set **System Disk** and **Data Disk** if required.

   -  System disk

      For the disk types supported by an ECS, see :ref:`EVS Disks <en-us_topic_0030828256>`.

      -  If the image based on which an ECS is created is not encrypted, the system disk of the ECS is not encrypted. If the image based on which an ECS is created is encrypted, the system disk of the ECS is automatically encrypted. For details, see :ref:`(Optional) Encryption-related parameters <en-us_topic_0163572589__en-us_topic_0144542112_li3286101316615>`.
      -  **Encryption**: indicates that the system disk is encrypted if you select this option. For details, see :ref:`(Optional) Encryption-related parameters <en-us_topic_0163572589__en-us_topic_0144542112_li3286101316615>`.
      -  For a P1 or P2 ECS, the system disk must be greater than or equal to 15 GB. It is recommended that the system disk be greater than 40 GB. A disk size must be an integer multiple of 10, for example, 60 GB or 70 GB. Otherwise, the system automatically rounds the value down, for example, 60 GB for value **68**.

   -  Data disk

      You can create multiple data disks for an ECS and enable required functions for each data disk. When creating an ECS, you can add up to 24 disks with customized sizes to it. After the ECS is created, you can add up to 60 disks to it.

      Click |image2| and set the following functions if required:

      -  **SCSI**: indicates that the device type of the data disk is SCSI if you select this option. For more information about SCSI disks and the ECSs that can be attached with SCSI disks, see :ref:`EVS Disks <en-us_topic_0030828256>`.

      -  **Share**: indicates that the EVS disk is sharable if you select this option. Such an EVS disk can be attached to multiple ECSs.

      -  **Encryption**: indicates that the data disk is encrypted if you select this option. For details, see :ref:`(Optional) Encryption-related parameters <en-us_topic_0163572589__en-us_topic_0144542112_li3286101316615>`.

      -  **Create Disk from Data Disk Image**: If you have created a data disk image on the **Image Management Service** page, when using a Windows or Linux image to create an ECS, you can use the data disk image to create data disks for the ECS.

         Click **Create Disk from Data Disk Image**. In the dialog box that is displayed, select your data disk image.

         .. note::

            -  One data disk image can be used for one data disk only.
            -  When you use a data disk image to create a disk, **SCSI**, **Encryption**, and **Share** are unavailable.
            -  For instructions about how to create a data disk image, see *Image Management Service User Guide*.

   -  .. _en-us_topic_0163572589__en-us_topic_0144542112_li3286101316615:

      (Optional) Encryption-related parameters

      To enable encryption, click **Create Xrole** to assign KMS access permissions to EVS. If you have rights granting permission, assign the KMS access permissions to EVS. If you do not have the permission, contact the user having the security administrator rights to assign the KMS access permissions. For more details, see :ref:`Can All Users Use the Encryption Feature? <en-us_topic_0047272493>`

      -  **Encryption**: indicates that the EVS disk has been encrypted.
      -  **Create Xrole**: assigns KMS access permissions to EVS to obtain KMS keys. After the permissions are assigned, follow-up operations do not require assigning permissions again.
      -  **KMS Key Name**: specifies the name of the key used by the encrypted EVS disk. You can select an existing key, or click **Create KMS Key** and create a new one on the KMS console. The default value is **evs/default**.
      -  **Xrole Name: EVSAccessKMS**: specifies that permissions have been assigned to EVS to obtain KMS keys for encrypting or decrypting EVS disks.
      -  **KMS Key ID**: specifies the ID of the key used by the encrypted data disk.

#. Click **Next: Configure Network**.
