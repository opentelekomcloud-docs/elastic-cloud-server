Managing Virtual IP Addresses
=============================

Configuring a Virtual IP Address for an ECS
-------------------------------------------

Manually configure the virtual IP address bound to an ECS.

The following OSs are used as examples here. For other OSs, see the help documents on their official websites.

-  Linux: CentOS 7.2 64bit and Ubuntu 22.04 server 64bit
-  Windows: Windows Server

**Linux (CentOS 7.2 64bit is used as an example.)**

#. .. _en-us_topic_0093492520__en-us_topic_0118499077_li528316578916:

   Obtain the NIC that the virtual IP address is to be bound and the connection of the NIC:

   **nmcli connection**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   |image1|

   The command output in this example is described as follows:

   -  **eth0** in the **DEVICE** column indicates the NIC that the virtual IP address is to be bound.
   -  **Wired connection 1** in the **NAME** column indicates the connection of the NIC.

#. .. _en-us_topic_0093492520__en-us_topic_0118499077_li20283257695:

   Add the virtual IP address for the connection:

   **nmcli connection modify "**\ *Connection name of the NIC*\ **"** **+ipv4.addresses** *Virtual IP address*

   Configure the parameters as follows:

   -  *Connection name of the NIC*: The connection name of the NIC obtained in :ref:`1 <en-us_topic_0093492520__en-us_topic_0118499077_li528316578916>`. In this example, the connection name is **Wired connection 1**.
   -  *Virtual IP address*: Enter the virtual IP address to be added. If you add multiple virtual IP addresses at a time, separate every two with a comma (,).

   Example commands:

   -  Adding a single virtual IP address: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" +ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125**
   -  Adding multiple virtual IP addresses: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" +ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125,172.16.0.126**

#. .. _en-us_topic_0093492520__en-us_topic_0118499077_li11209933188:

   Make the configuration in :ref:`2 <en-us_topic_0093492520__en-us_topic_0118499077_li20283257695>` take effect:

   **nmcli connection up "**\ *Connection name of the NIC*\ **"**

   In this example, run the following command:

   **nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   |image2|

#. Check whether the virtual IP address has been bound:

   **ip a**

   Information similar to the following is displayed. In the command output, the virtual IP address 172.16.0.125 is bound to NIC eth0.

   |image3|

   .. note::

      To delete an added virtual IP address, perform the following steps:

      a. Delete the virtual IP address from the connection of the NIC:

         **nmcli connection modify "**\ *Connection name of the NIC*\ **"** **-ipv4.addresses** *Virtual IP address*

         To delete multiple virtual IP addresses at a time, separate every two with a comma (,). Example commands are as follows:

         -  Deleting a single virtual IP address: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" -ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125**
         -  Deleting multiple virtual IP addresses: **nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" -ipv4.addresses** **172.16.0.125,172.16.0.126**

      b. Make the deletion take effect by referring to :ref:`3 <en-us_topic_0093492520__en-us_topic_0118499077_li11209933188>`.

**Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 server 64bit is used as an example.)**

If an ECS runs Ubuntu 22 or Ubuntu 20, perform the following operations:

#. Obtain the NIC that the virtual IP address is to be bound:

   **ifconfig**

   Information similar to the following is displayed. In this example, the NIC bound to the virtual IP address is **eth0**.

   .. code-block::

      root@ecs-X-ubantu:~# ifconfig
      eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
              inet 172.16.0.210  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 172.16.0.255

              TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
      ...

#. Switch to the **/etc/netplan** directory:

   **cd /etc/netplan**

#. .. _en-us_topic_0093492520__en-us_topic_0118499077_li1244016171484:

   Add a virtual IP address to the NIC.

   a. Open the configuration file **01-netcfg.yaml**:

      **vim 01-netcfg.yaml**

   b. Press **i** to enter the editing mode.

   c. In the NIC configuration area, add a virtual IP address.

      In this example, add a virtual IP address for **eth0**:

      **addresses:**

      **- 172.16.0.26/32**

      The file content is as follows:

      .. code-block::

         network:
             version: 2
             renderer: NetworkManager
             ethernets:
                 eth0:
                     dhcp4: true
                     addresses:
                     - 172.16.0.26/32
                 eth1:
                     dhcp4: true
                 eth2:
                     dhcp4: true
                 eth3:
                     dhcp4: true
                 eth4:
                     dhcp4: true

   d. Press **Esc**, enter **:wq!**, save the configuration, and exit.

   **netplan apply**

#. Check whether the virtual IP address has been bound:

   **ip a**

   Information similar to the following is displayed. In the command output, the virtual IP address 172.16.0.26 is bound to NIC eth0.

   .. note::

      To delete an added virtual IP address, perform the following steps:

      a. Open the configuration file **01-netcfg.yaml** and delete the virtual IP address of the corresponding NIC by referring to :ref:`3 <en-us_topic_0093492520__en-us_topic_0118499077_li1244016171484>`.
      b. Make the deletion take effect by referring to :ref:`4 <en-us_topic_0093492520__en-us_topic_0118499077_li1071922334218>`.

**Windows OS** **(Windows Server is used as an example here.)**

#. In **Control Panel**, click **Network and Sharing Center**, and click the corresponding local connection.

#. On the displayed page, click **Properties**.

#. On the **Network** tab page, select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**.

#. Click **Properties**.

#. Select **Use the following IP address** and set **IP address** to the private IP address of the ECS, for example, 10.0.0.101.

      :alt: **Figure 1** Configuring private IP address

      **Figure 1** Configuring private IP address

#. Click **Advanced**.

#. On the **IP Settings** tab, click **Add** in the **IP addresses** area.

   Add the virtual IP address, for example, 10.0.0.154.

      :alt: **Figure 2** Configuring virtual IP address

      **Figure 2** Configuring virtual IP address

#. Click **OK**.

#. In the **Start** menu, open the Windows command line window and run the following command to check whether the virtual IP address has been configured:

   **ipconfig /all**

   In the command output, **IPv4 Address** is the virtual IP address 10.0.0.154, indicating that the virtual IP address of the ECS NIC has been correctly configured.

Scenarios
---------

A virtual IP address provides the second IP address for one or more ECS NICs, improving high availability between the ECSs.

One NIC can be bound with up to 10 virtual IP addresses, and one virtual IP address can be bound to up to 10 NICs. Multiple ECSs deployed to work in active/standby mode can be bound with the same virtual IP address for disaster recovery.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image4| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. On the **Elastic Cloud Server** page, click the name of the target ECS.

   The page providing details about the ECS is displayed.

#. Click the **NICs** tab. Then, click **Manage Virtual IP Address**.

   The **Virtual Private Cloud** page is displayed.

#. On the **IP Addresses** tab, select a desired one or click **Assign Virtual IP Address** for a new one.

#. Click **Bind to Server** in the **Operation** column and select the target ECS name and the NIC to bind the virtual IP address to the ECS NIC.

   For more information about virtual IP addresses, see *Virtual Private Cloud User Guide*.
