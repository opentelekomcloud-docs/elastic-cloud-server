Modifying a Private IP Address
==============================

Scenarios
---------

You can modify the private IP address of the primary NIC. If you want to modify the private IP address of an extension NIC, delete the NIC and attach a new NIC.

Constraints
-----------

-  The ECS must be stopped.
-  If a virtual IP address or DNAT rule has been configured for the NIC, cancel the configuration before modifying the private IP address.
-  If the NIC has an IPv6 address, its private IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 address) cannot be modified.
-  Before changing the private IP address of an ELB backend server, delete the backend server group.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. Click the name of the target ECS.

   The page providing details about the ECS is displayed.

#. Click the **NICs** tab. Locate the row containing the primary NIC and click **Modify Private IP**.

   The **Modify Private IP** dialog box is displayed.

#. Change the subnet and private IP address of the primary NIC as required.

   .. note::

      Subnets can be changed only within the same VPC.

   If the target private IP address is not specified, the system will automatically assign one to the primary NIC.
