Deleting the Initial Password for Logging In to a Windows ECS
=============================================================

Scenarios
---------

After you obtain the initial password, it is a good practice to delete it to ensure system security.

Deleting the initial password does not affect ECS operation or login. Once deleted, the password cannot be retrieved. Before you delete a password, it is a good practice to record it.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.

#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.

#. On the **Elastic Cloud Server** page, select the target ECS.

#. In the **Operation** column, click **More** and select **Delete Password**.

   The system displays a message, asking you whether you want to delete the password.

#. Click **OK** to delete the password.
