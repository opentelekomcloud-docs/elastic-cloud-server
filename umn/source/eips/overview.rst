EIP
---

The Elastic IP (EIP) service enables your cloud resources to communicate with the Internet using static public IP addresses and scalable bandwidths. EIPs can be bound to or unbound from ECSs, BMSs, virtual IP addresses, NAT gateways, or load balancers.

Each EIP can be used by only one cloud resource at a time. EIPs must be in the same region as the bound resources. EIPs cannot be used across regions.
