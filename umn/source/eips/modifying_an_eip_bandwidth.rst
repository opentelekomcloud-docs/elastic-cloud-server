Modifying an EIP Bandwidth
==========================

Scenarios
---------

The bandwidth of an EIP enables data transfer between the public network and an ECS. If the bandwidth of the EIP does not meet your service requirements, you can adjust the bandwidth by referring to this section.

Constraints
-----------

Reducing bandwidths may cause packet loss. Exercise caution when performing this operation.

Prerequisites
-------------

An EIP has been bound to an ECS. For details, see :ref:`Binding an EIP <en-us_topic_0174917535>`.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.
#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select a region and project.
#. Under **Computing**, click **Elastic Cloud Server**.
#. In the ECS list, locate the row containing the target ECS and choose **More** > **Manage Network** > **Modify Bandwidth** in the **Operation** column.
#. Change the bandwidth name and size as prompted.
